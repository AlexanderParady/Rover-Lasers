# Rover-Lasers
The Arduino program and KiCAD schematic both use external libraries to function.

For schematic: place the arudino.lib file as a usable library in KiCAD.

For program: utilize the internal "Robot IR Remote" library found on the Arduino IDE or download the ZIP file titled "Arduino-IRremote"

The program executes by waiting for an input of 0 or 1 from the remote and then performing either LED patter either in sequence or all at once.
This program uses LEDs as a place holder for lasers.
